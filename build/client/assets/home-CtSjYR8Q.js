Many of us have been quite upset ever since. It’s wrong on many fronts: the Governor conditioned his gift on using the name, the College has reaped enormous benefits from the Chapel for more than a century and the cancel culture that led to this act needs to be challenged. Erasure of Governor Mead’s legacy, based on some remarks in a 1912 speech, is directly contrary to the College’s policy on free expression and its professed tolerance for views that are controversial. Indeed, it conflicts with the very purpose of an institution of higher learning, which is to seek knowledge and pursue the truth."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Accordingly, the Governor’s estate has filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking justice from the College.
