  "The Mead Memorial Chapel at Middlebury College is a historic monument built to honor the Mead family’s legacy, specifically that of Vermont Governor John Mead. In 2021, Middlebury College’s trustees elected to remove the Mead family name from the chapel, citing remarks from a 1912 speech given by Governor Mead. The decision caused significant outcry among the Mead descendants and associated community, who asserted that the deed for the chapel explicitly required the continued use of the Mead name. The estate filed suit against the college, contending both breach of a covenant and injury to the Mead family’s reputation and intent, leading to an ongoing dispute punctuated by motions, appeals, and considerable media coverage.";

  "Middlebury College violated the conditions of Governor Mead's donation by unilaterally removing the family name from the chapel, despite explicit deed language requiring perpetual naming.",
  "The college’s action constitutes a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the original agreement.",

  "The decision was in line with contemporary moves among higher education institutions to reassess historical symbols and legacies, aligning with values of inclusion and critique of problematic histories.",
  "The removal did not constitute a specific breach and no compensable harm has been suffered, as the building, use, and mission remain unchanged.",

export const CurrentOutcome =
  "As of late 2025, the legal process remains ongoing. Motions for summary judgment have resolved some issues in the estate’s favor at the Superior Court level, including acknowledgment of certain restrictive covenants, but the question of final remedy and standing is under appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. The outcome will determine the future of the Mead name and establish precedent for donor intent in the context of evolving institutional ethics. Updates will be posted here as the court process continues.";
